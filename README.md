# Course_work_cpp_tbc

## Overview

Welcome to the Course_work_cpp_tbc repository.  
This repository contains my college coursework for the 2025 semester at The British College, where I am pursuing a degree in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics.

The project is organized into four coursework assignments, each focusing on different aspects of C++ programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

---

## Coursework Breakdown

### Course_I_C++

Covers the fundamentals of C++, including data types, control structures (if-else, switch, loops), and arrays.  
The focus is on writing simple programs to demonstrate a clear understanding of these concepts.

### Course_II_C++

Includes assignments from Week 5 to Week 9, centered around Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Tasks involve designing and implementing classes, constructors, and object-based logic.

### Course_III_C++

Explores key OOP concepts such as operator overloading, custom exceptions, and inheritance.  
Assignments focus on solving problems using these advanced principles in practical scenarios.

### Course_IV_C++

Introduces advanced C++ features, including STL containers, custom Stack and Queue implementations, and linked lists.  
Tasks require implementing efficient and reusable code using these advanced data structures and techniques.
